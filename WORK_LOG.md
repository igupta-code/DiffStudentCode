| Feb 24 |  class   | In class, Tony and I came up with a tabulation approach: it's a little slow, but I think it would work. The connection between the smaller problem and adding a letter to the sequence you are looking at: you want to find and remove the letter you are adding in one sequence in the other. If you can find this letter, solve the sub-problem (by removing the added letter from both sequences) and add one. If this is bigger than the longest sequence you've found, update. |

I think we don't need to fill in the 0 indicies of the table because they are never used. I was also a bit stuck on how to find which stirng the "new letter" way coming from. |

It does use linear time to search for the last letter, but it is pretty quick considering that. I had some issues with going out of bounds. In the end I decided to add back in the empty rows of zeros as a buffer to prevent this. |

But I was talking to Tony about just using the previous three adjacent squares. I'm not 100% sure why this works but using the top left square if the number matches definitely makes sense. |

I added some comments and cleaned up a bit. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
